# About This Project — NBA Player Forecasting (Python + SQL)
*By Edwin (Ed) Bleiler*

## Overview
This project demonstrates how structured analytics, SQL modeling, and Python-based data pipelines can be applied to sports data to produce clear, interpretable forecasts.  
The process mirrors the structured problem-solving and analytical rigor used in Strategy & Operations, Product, and Chief of Staff roles.

## Methods
- NBA API ingestion  
- Normalized SQL data model  
- Rolling performance trends  
- Volatility-based consistency scoring  
- Opponent defense–vs–position metrics  
- Simple, transparent forecasting logic

## Example Output
| Player | Avg FP (L10) | Consistency | Opp DvP | Forecast |
|--------|--------------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Player A | 41.2 | 87 | 1.03 | 44.5 |
| Player B | 36.5 | 78 | 0.95 | 34.1 |

## Why It Matters
The forecasting domain is sports, but the underlying capabilities translate directly into:
- Data-informed decision frameworks  
- Structured operational analysis  
- System design and repeatable workflows  
- Product-oriented problem decomposition  
- Clear communication and documentation  

These are the same disciplines used across Strategy, Product, and Chief of Staff work.
