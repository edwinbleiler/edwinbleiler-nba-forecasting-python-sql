# NBA Forecasting Archive (Retired)

This repository contains the **original early version** of my NBA forecasting work.

It has been **replaced** by a significantly improved, production-grade pipeline:

👉 **New Project:** https://github.com/edwinbleiler/edwinbleiler-nba-projection-system

This archive remains public for:
- Historical reference  
- Portfolio evolution  
- SEO continuity  
- Code comparison  
- Transparency in my development process  

## Why It’s Archived

This older version lacked:
- Proper modular structure  
- CI/CD automation  
- Robust feature engineering  
- Daily ingestion pipeline  
- Clear ML lifecycle management  

The new system includes all of that and more.
